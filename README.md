# Revenue-Association-Prediction-for-The-Movie-Database-TMDb

I analysed the movie dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I used the following Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I used jupyter notebook for this project, if required .py can be downloaded from the .ipynb file.
About Dataset: 
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. 
There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. 
The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars.
